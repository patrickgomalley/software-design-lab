# Patrick O'Malley's Technical Journal

Journal 1

I spent two hours doing a datacamp.com lesson on the terminal. I learned again to ask where I am in the terminal and how to identify files and directories. I moved directories and copied, moved, renamed and deleted files. I learned how to view a file’s contents overall and piece by piece. I learned about looking at the start of a file and the tail. I learned about the “less” command. I also learned how to select columns from data that I wanted to see. I spent another two hours going through the tutorial on the command line twice that is in the syllabus. My question is that when I opened my cheat-sheet.txt file from my desktop, there was nothing in it, it was just an empty file. But when I asked the terminal what its contents were, it told me what I had put into it. 


Journal 2

I tried to use Learn Python the Hard Way for an hour, but I ran into problems because it said that you needed Python 2 and I have Python 3 on my system. I read “What is Python Used For?” And spent about 2 hours in a Python tutorial on datacamp.com. I learned Python basics like the interface and when to use Python. I learned how it could be used as a calculator and also the variables and types and how to assign. I started playing around with lists, like creating different types. There was a section on lists of lists. I also have a few Python books that I spent about an hour reading through just to get familiar with the terminology. 

Journal 3

I thought a little bit outside the box this week. I really want to gain familiarity with textual analysis, so beyond the required readings, I read numerous others on topic modeling (one by Lisa Rhody on figurative language in poetry and topic modeling), basic algorithms, and textual analysis for marketing. I revisited my data camp Python course to solidify things I already learned. Also, I was very moved by the readings on accessibility this week, and it got me thinking of accessible copy on sites and apps. I wants to start working as a freelance writer, so I took a two hour class on copywriting and SEO. Makes me think of all the ways I could create copy that is readily available to all people (also I really liked the article about using HTML friendly coding for all sites, so that changes the way I would write too). One thing I considered is writing without nuance for copy, because that makes it harder for people like the young man in the case study chapter with autism to understand, and also affects translatability into other languages for the Hispanic woman. I wonder, Patrick, in your experience with assistive reading devices if nuance gets difficult to interpret or if that is not a problem for you based on your expertise with English? I only wonder because I know they read rather fast, and I just wonder how difficult it is to retain everything read to you? One last thing I did was begin the CSS/HTML course on Khan Academy.
