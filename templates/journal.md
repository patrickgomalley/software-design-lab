# Patrick O'Malley's Technical Journal

Journal 1

I spent two hours doing a datacamp.com lesson on the terminal. I learned again to ask where I am in the terminal and how to identify files and directories. I moved directories and copied, moved, renamed and deleted files. I learned how to view a file’s contents overall and piece by piece. I learned about looking at the start of a file and the tail. I learned about the “less” command. I also learned how to select columns from data that I wanted to see. I spent another two hours going through the tutorial on the command line twice that is in the syllabus. My question is that when I opened my cheat-sheet.txt file from my desktop, there was nothing in it, it was just an empty file. But when I asked the terminal what its contents were, it told me what I had put into it. 


Journal 2

I tried to use Learn Python the Hard Way for an hour, but I ran into problems because it said that you needed Python 2 and I have Python 3 on my system. I read “What is Python Used For?” And spent about 2 hours in a Python tutorial on datacamp.com. I learned Python basics like the interface and when to use Python. I learned how it could be used as a calculator and also the variables and types and how to assign. I started playing around with lists, like creating different types. There was a section on lists of lists. I also have a few Python books that I spent about an hour reading through just to get familiar with the terminology. 

Journal 3

I thought a little bit outside the box this week. I really want to gain familiarity with textual analysis, so beyond the required readings, I read numerous others on topic modeling (one by Lisa Rhody on figurative language in poetry and topic modeling), basic algorithms, and textual analysis for marketing. I revisited my data camp Python course to solidify things I already learned. Also, I was very moved by the readings on accessibility this week, and it got me thinking of accessible copy on sites and apps. I wants to start working as a freelance writer, so I took a two hour class on copywriting and SEO. Makes me think of all the ways I could create copy that is readily available to all people (also I really liked the article about using HTML friendly coding for all sites, so that changes the way I would write too). One thing I considered is writing without nuance for copy, because that makes it harder for people like the young man in the case study chapter with autism to understand, and also affects translatability into other languages for the Hispanic woman. I wonder, Patrick, in your experience with assistive reading devices if nuance gets difficult to interpret or if that is not a problem for you based on your expertise with English? I only wonder because I know they read rather fast, and I just wonder how difficult it is to retain everything read to you? One last thing I did was begin the CSS/HTML course on Khan Academy. 


<b>BONUS</b> Journal for missing class last Wednesday because of weather

Hour 1: Worked on the Khan Academy HTML/CSS tutorial. Played with Git until I figured out how to post my journal.

Hour 2: W3schools tutorial on HTML… (went from HTML HOME to HTML CSS)

Questions on HTML: The Khan Academy course said that an image needs to be defined by a URL and cannot exist on your own computer solely, but the w3schools course used a JPG locally. Do you know what I am missing?

Does using <h1> - <h6> always make the headings smaller in size as the page goes down? Do you need to specify with style=“font-size: Xpx;”>     or, can you just re-use h1 and h2 over and over again so they are the same size?

Do you know if there is a “View page source” in Safari? Same with “Inspect element”

When would you use <b>  vs.  <strong> and also <i> vs. <em> ? The w3schools course says the latter two are used when there is “semantic importance” but they seems to do the same thing. Or that the text is “important,” so what does “important” mean to the browser if you just really want it to be bold or italic?

Hour 3: W3schools tutorial on HTML (HTML Links to HTML Layout). I don’t have any questions… the code got much more intense here so I skimmed through just to know what HTML is capable of so that I can refer back later. This is definitely a useful resource!!

Hour 4: W3schools tutorial (HTML Responsive to HTML Input Attributes)



Journal 4   February 21-27

Hour 1: Python tutorial on datacamp. I learned about lists. I have questions about slicing, or subsetting.

Hour 2: Python tutorial on datacamp. Lists of lists and manipulating lists. Changing elements of list of lists is intense, but appears manageable on the surface level…. There is just so many different ways to do it. 

Hour 3: W3schools tutorial (HTML5 module). I am a little confused about how HTML 5 works with other versions of HTML (but in going through the HTML5 module, the HTML5 Migration section addresses some of this).  But it seems like there is a lot of room for flexibility for incorporating different forms of media. The <article> and <section> elements, and how they are used together, is hard to wrap my head around. 

Hour 4: W3schools tutorial (HTML graphics module, HTML APIs, HTML Examples modules). I would like to understand more how the Canvas element stores graphics made in JavaScript and how you do that and pull them to use later in HTML. I am beginning to be able to see the difference between Canvas and SVG. 

Hour 5: Python tutorial on datacamp. Functions and Packages. I’d like to learn more about the functions they did not go into detail about in this tutorial, or what all Python is capable of. I’d love a Python tutorial similar to the W3schools tutorial on HTML.
